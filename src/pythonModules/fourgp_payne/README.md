# fourgp_payne

This package provides a simple wrapper for passing spectra in SpectrumLibraries to the Payne.

It requires that you have installed pytorch in the python virtual environment you are using.

At the time of writing there are various different versions of the Payne. This is a lightly edited copy of Yuan-Sen Ting's version, as used in the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01530>

Yuan-Sen's GitHub repository is here: <https://github.com/tingyuansen/The_Payne>
